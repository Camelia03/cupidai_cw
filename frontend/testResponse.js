I started going regularly, either weekly or bi-weekly, and I'm still enjoying it in September. All the hot yoga classes I've attended with Stephen B or Roberto have been amazing.\n\nOver the past few months, I've also explored Yin Yoga with Fiona Mc or Reeta, Pilates with Chris Feld or Maider, and Flow with Neasa. I've loved all of them, but for some reason, Neasa's sessions are next level; she often incorporates poems and daily best practices.\n\nYoga Hub Camden has become my go-to place. The reception staff is always lovely, and the place is clean and calm. The wooden stairs have also soothing effect on me, connecting me to a sense of peace and tranquility, helping me disconnect from daily stress and be present in my practice.",

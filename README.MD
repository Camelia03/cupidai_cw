# Getting Started with an npm Project

## To start an npm project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/DarrachBarneveld/cupidai.git

```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the project dependencies using npm:

```
cd <project_directory>
npm install

```

This command will install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.

### 3. Start the Server

After installing the dependencies, start the server by running the following command:

```
npm start
```

This command will start the server and typically outputs the URL where the server is running. By default, it's usually localhost:1234.

### 4. Visit the Server URL

Open your web browser and navigate to the URL where the server is running, typically localhost:1234 unless specified otherwise.

You should now see the application running in your browser!
